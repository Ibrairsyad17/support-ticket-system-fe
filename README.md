# ADS Digital Partner - Support Ticket System Frontend (Helptix)

This repository contains the source code for my internship project at PT. Adma Digital Solusi. It is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) website that can connect to third-party social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and X to handle customer complaints regarding product services. Additionally, this website can assign customer complaints to various employees within the company to resolve the issues. 

The project is deployed and can be accessed [here] (https://www.helptix.my.id/)
